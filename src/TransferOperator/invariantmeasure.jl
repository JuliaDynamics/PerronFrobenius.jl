Compute the invariant probability distribution from a transfer operator.

## Computing an invariant probability distribution
The distribution is taken as a left eigenvector of the transfer matrix,
obtained by repeated application of the transfer operator on a randomly
initialised distribution until the probability distribution converges.

## Keyword arguments
- `N`: the maximum number of iterations.
- `tolerance` and `delta`: decides when convergence is achieved.
