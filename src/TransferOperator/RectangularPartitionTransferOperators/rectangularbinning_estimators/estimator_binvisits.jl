                boundary_condition = :none)

Estimate transfer operator from information about which bin
gets visited by which points of the orbit.

## Transition probabilities
To determine the transition probabilities, we pre-allocate two index vectors
(`I` and `J`) and a probability vector (`P`). After the transition probabilities
have been determined, the vectors are combined into a sparse matrix (the
transfer matrix), which typically have very few nonzero entries (often only a
few percent).

## Memory allocation
To not allocate too much memory, `allocate_frac` controls what fraction of the
total number of possible transitions (``n_{states}^2``) we pre-allocate for.

## Example usage

```
# Random orbit.
orbit = rand(1000, 3)
x, y, z = orbit[:, 1], orbit[:, 2], orbit[:, 3]

# Embedding E = {(y(t+1), y(t), x(t))}
E = embed([x, y], [2, 2, 1], [1, 0, 0]);

# Which bin sizes to use along each dimension?
ϵ = [.4, .2, .4]

# Identify which bins of the partition resulting
# from using ϵ each point of the embedding visits.
visited_bins = assign_bin_labels(E, ϵ)

# Which are the visited bins, which points
# visits which bin, repetitions, etc...
binvisits = organize_bin_labels(visited_bins)

# Use that information to estimate transfer operator
TO = transferoperator(binvisits)

# Verify that TO is Markov (NB. last row might be zero!,
# then this test might fail)
all(sum(TO, 2) .≈ 1)
```
