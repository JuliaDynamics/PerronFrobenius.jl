    transferoperator_triangulation_approx(invariant_pts,
        DT::DelaunayTriangulation, n_sample_pts::Int = 200, sample_randomly::Bool = false)

Approximate the transfer operator over a triangulation of `invariant_pts`. Does the same
as the single-argument version of the function, but requires that the triangulation
is precomputed on `invariant_pts[1:(end - 1)]` (excluding the last point).

## Example

```julia
# Create some random points and make sure they are invariant
pts = [rand(3) for i = 1:30]
invariant_pts = invariantize(pts)

# Triangulate all but the last point (exclude the last, so that an image simplex
# always exists)
DT = DelaunayTriangulation(invariant_pts[1:(end - 1)])

# Compute the transfer operator
to = transferoperator_triangulation_approx(invariant_pts, DT)
```

## References
The idea of using a triangulation estimator to compute the transfer operator was
introduced in [1], where it is used to compute physical invariant measures. To compute
a physical invariant measure from a transfer operator `to`, simply call
`invariantmeasure(to)`.

    transferoperator_triangulation_approx(invariant_pts; n_sample_pts::Int = 200,
        sample_randomly::Bool = false) -> TransferOperatorTriangulationApprox

Compute an approximation of the transfer operator over a triangulated partition of the
provided points (`invariant_pts`). The estimator assumes that the points are invariant
under the forward projection of the simplices in the triangulation, which means that
the last point must be contained within the convex hull of all previous points.

*Tip: The `invariantize` function from `StateSpaceReconstruction` can be used to move the
last point toward the center of the embedding until invariance is achieved.*

This function computes approximate simplex intersections and is slow for very large
triangulations. It should only be used on small to moderately sized datasets (i.e.
in the order of hundreds of points). For larger datasets, use a rectangular estimator.

Returns a  instance.

## Example
```julia
# Create some random points and make sure they are invariant
pts = [rand(3) for i = 1:30]
invariant_pts = invariantize(pts)

# Compute the transfer operator
to = transferoperator_triangulation_approx(invariant_pts)
```
