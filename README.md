# PerronFrobenius.jl

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kahaaga/PerronFrobenius.jl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kahaaga/PerronFrobenius.jl)

A Julia package to compute approximation to the transfer operator
(Perron-Frobenius operator) and invariant measures from partitioned state
space reconstructions.

`PerronFrobenius.jl` provides essential functionality for the  [`CausalityTools.jl`](https://github.com/kahaaga/CausalityTools.jl) and
	and [`TimeseriesSurrogates.jl`](https://github.com/kahaaga/TimeseriesSurrogates.jl)
	packages.
